# OYO_Project

This project analyzes hotel booking data using Python and SQL to generate insights such as:
1.Revenue per city
2.Booking growth trends
3.Cancellation rates per property
4.Outlier detection using Z-score
5.Visualizations of top-performing cities

The goal is to showcase data analysis, statistical methods, and visualization skills with a real-world inspired dataset.
